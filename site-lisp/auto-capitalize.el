;;; Commentary:

;; In `auto-capitalize' minor mode, the first word at the beginning of
;; a paragraph or sentence (i.e. at `left-margin' on a line following
;; `paragraph-separate', after `paragraph-start' at `left-margin', or
;; after `sentence-end') is automatically capitalized when a following
;; whitespace or punctuation character is inserted.
;;
;; The `auto-capitalize-words' variable can be customized so that
;; commonly used proper nouns and acronyms are capitalized or upcased,
;; respectively.
;;
;; The `auto-capitalize-yank' option controls whether words in yanked
;; text should by capitalized in the same way.
;;
;; To install auto-capitalize.el, copy it to a `load-path' directory,
;; `M-x byte-compile-file' it, and add this to your
;; site-lisp/default.el or ~/.emacs file:
;; 	(autoload 'auto-capitalize-mode "auto-capitalize"
;; 	  "Toggle `auto-capitalize' minor mode in this buffer." t)
;; 	(autoload 'turn-on-auto-capitalize-mode "auto-capitalize"
;; 	  "Turn on `auto-capitalize' minor mode in this buffer." t)
;; 	(autoload 'enable-auto-capitalize-mode "auto-capitalize"
;; 	  "Enable `auto-capitalize' minor mode in this buffer." t)
;;
;; To turn on (unconditional) capitalization in all Text modes, add
;; this to your site-lisp/default.el or ~/.emacs file:
;; 	(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-capitalize-mode)
;; To enable (interactive) capitalization in all Text modes, add this
;; to your site-lisp/default.el or ~/.emacs file:
;; 	(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'enable-auto-capitalize-mode)
;;

;; In order to avoid, that in Auctex, math-mode constructions like
;; $A_i$ get expanded to $A_I$ use set `auto-capitalize-predicate' was
;; set to (lambda () (not (texmathp))) as in the following. However
;; `texmathp' function doesn't save match data but it's run in
;; `auto-capitalize' that is installed into `after-change-functions'
;; hook however such functions (info "(elisp)Change Hooks") must
;; restore match data otherwise unexpected behavior will appear, as
;; it's in the case of the following BUG
;; see:https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=23180

;; (defun my-set-auto-capitalize ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (set (make-local-variable 'auto-capitalize-predicate)
;;        (lambda () (not (save-match-data (texmathp))))))
;; 					; suggestion from Mosè Giordano
;; (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'my-set-auto-capitalize)
;; See the modification in the function auto-capitalize adding `save-match-data'

;; To prevent a word from ever being capitalized or upcased
;; (e.g. "http"), simply add it (in lowercase) to the
;; `auto-capitalize-words' list.
;;
;; To prevent a word in the `auto-capitalize-words' list from being
;; capitalized or upcased in a particular context (e.g.
;; "GNU.emacs.sources"), insert the following whitespace or
;; punctuation character with `M-x quoted-insert' (e.g. `gnu C-q .').
;;
;; To enable contractions based on a word in the
;; `auto-capitalize-words' list to be capitalized or upcased
;; (e.g. "I'm") in the middle of a sentence in Text mode, define the
;; apostrophe as a punctuation character or as a symbol that joins two
;; words:
;; 	;; Use "_" instead of "." to define apostrophe as a symbol:
;; 	(modify-syntax-entry ?' ".   " text-mode-syntax-table) ; was "w   "

;;; Code:

;; Rationale:
;;
;; The implementation of auto-capitalize via an after-change-function is
;; somewhat complicated, but two simpler designs don't work due to
;; quirks in Emacs' implementation itself:
;;
;; One idea is to advise `self-insert-command' to `upcase'
;; `last-command-char' before it is run, but command_loop_1 optimizes
;; out the call to the Lisp binding with its C binding
;; (Fself_insert_command), which prevents any advice from being run.
;;
;; Another idea is to use a before-change-function to `upcase'
;; `last-command-char', but the change functions are called by
;; internal_self_insert, which has already had `last-command-char'
;; passed to it as a C function parameter by command_loop_1.

;; Package interface:

(provide 'auto-capitalize)

(require 'cl)				; find, minusp


;; User options:

(defvar auto-capitalize nil
  "If non-nil, the first word of a sentence is automatically capitalized.
If non-nil but not t, query the user before capitalizing a word.
This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion\;
see `\\[auto-capitalize-mode]', `\\[turn-on-capitalize-mode]', or
`\\[enable-auto-capitalize-mode]'.")

(make-variable-buffer-local 'auto-capitalize)

(put 'auto-capitalize 'variable-interactive
     "XAutomatically capitalize the first word of each sentence? (t, nil, or 'query): ")

(or (assq 'auto-capitalize minor-mode-alist)
    (setq minor-mode-alist
	  (cons (list 'auto-capitalize " Cap") minor-mode-alist)))


(defvar auto-capitalize-yank nil
  "*If non-nil, the first word of yanked sentences are automatically capitalized.")

(put 'auto-capitalize-yank 'variable-interactive
     "XAutomatically capitalize the first word of yanked sentences? (t or nil): ")


;; User variables:

(defvar auto-capitalize-words '("I")	;  "Stallman" "GNU" "http"
  "If non-nil, a list of proper nouns or acronyms.
If `auto-capitalize' mode is on, these words will be automatically
capitalized or upcased as listed (mixed case is allowable as well), even
in the middle of a sentence.  A lowercase word will not have its case
modified.")

(defvar auto-capitalize-predicate nil
  "If non-nil, a function that determines whether to enable capitalization.
In auto-capitalize mode, it is called with no arguments and should return a
non-nil value if the current word is within \"normal\" text.")

;; Internal variables:

(defconst auto-capitalize-version "$Revision: 2.20 $"
  "This version of auto-capitalize.el")


;; Commands:

(defun auto-capitalize-mode (&optional arg)
  "Toggle `auto-capitalize' minor mode in this buffer.
With optional prefix ARG, turn `auto-capitalize' mode on iff ARG is positive.
This sets `auto-capitalize' to t or nil (for this buffer) and ensures that
`auto-capitalize' is installed in `after-change-functions' (for all buffers)."
  (interactive "P")
  (setq auto-capitalize
	(if (null arg)
	    (not auto-capitalize)
	  (> (prefix-numeric-value arg) 0)))
  (add-hook 'after-change-functions 'auto-capitalize nil t))

(defun turn-on-auto-capitalize-mode ()
  "Turn on `auto-capitalize' mode in this buffer.
This sets `auto-capitalize' to t."
  (interactive)
  (auto-capitalize-mode 1))

(defun turn-off-auto-capitalize-mode ()
  "Turn off `auto-capitalize' mode in this buffer.
This sets `auto-capitalize' to nil."
  (interactive)
  (auto-capitalize-mode -1))

(defun enable-auto-capitalize-mode ()
  "Enable `auto-capitalize' mode in this buffer.
This sets `auto-capitalize' to `query'."
  (interactive)
  (setq auto-capitalize 'query))


;; Internal functions:

(defun auto-capitalize-sentence-end()
  "portability function. emacs 22.0.50 introduced sentence-end
function, not available on other emacsen.
Fix known to work on 23.0.90 and later"
  (if (fboundp 'sentence-end)
      (sentence-end)
    sentence-end))

(defun auto-capitalize (beg end length)
  "If `auto-capitalize' mode is on, then capitalize the previous word.
The previous word is capitalized (or upcased) if it is a member of the
`auto-capitalize-words' list; or if it begins a paragraph or sentence.

Capitalization occurs only if the current command was invoked via a
self-inserting non-word character (e.g. whitespace or punctuation)\; but
if the `auto-capitalize-yank' option is set, then the first word of
yanked sentences will be capitalized as well.

Capitalization can be disabled in specific contexts via the
`auto-capitalize-predicate' variable.

This should be installed as an `after-change-function'."
